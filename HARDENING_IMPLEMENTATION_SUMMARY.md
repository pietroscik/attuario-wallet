# Hardening & Conformance Pass - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation addresses the hardening and conformance requirements for attuario-wallet to ensure zero "no_adapter" errors for pools in config.json, consistent selection/ranking with constraints, and clean .env/secrets management.

## Issue Requirements vs Implementation

### ✅ 1. Adapter Registry: Eliminate Spurious "no_adapter" Errors

**Requirement:**
- Integrate fallback pool key resolution inside `get_adapter`
- Verify all pools chosen by scorer exist in config.json
- Add clear logging for `unknown_type` and `adapter_init_error`

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Pool key resolution (`_resolve_pool_key`) was already integrated at line 95 of `adapters/__init__.py`
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for all three error conditions:
  - `no_adapter`: Shows pool_id and explains it's not in config.json
  - `unknown_type`: Shows pool_id, invalid type, and lists all available adapter types
  - `adapter_init_error`: Shows pool_id, adapter type, exception name, and full error message

**Files Modified:**
- `bots/wave_rotation/adapters/__init__.py` (8 lines added)

### ✅ 2. Config & Selection: TVL/Staleness/Scan

**Requirement:**
- Align realistic thresholds for CI (min_tvl_usd, top_n_scan, max_apy_staleness_min)
- Set SEARCH_SCOPE=CONFIG_ONLY for CI jobs
- Confirm REQUIRE_ADAPTER_BEFORE_RANK=1

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Verified config.json already has appropriate settings:
  - `min_tvl_usd: 0` (suitable for DRY-RUN/CI)
  - `top_n_scan: 1000` (appropriate scan size)
  - `max_apy_staleness_min: 1440` (24-hour staleness tolerance)
- ✅ CI workflow already sets `SEARCH_SCOPE=CONFIG_ONLY` (line 49)
- ✅ Added explicit `REQUIRE_ADAPTER_BEFORE_RANK=1` setting to workflow

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/run-strategy.yml` (enhanced with explicit settings)

### ✅ 3. .env / Secrets / Variables: Local ↔ CI Parity

**Requirement:**
- Clean up Variables (remove inline comments, fix corrupted addresses)
- Keep sensitive keys in Secrets only
- Create ephemeral .env in CI jobs

**Implementation:**
- ✅ Removed inline comment from CBBTC_ERC4626_VAULT in .env.example
- ✅ Verified WSTETH_BASE address is correct: `0xc1CBa3fCea344f92D9239c08C0568f6F2F0ee452`
- ✅ Added new CI workflow step to create ephemeral .env file with all configuration variables
- ✅ Ephemeral .env provides transparency and reproducibility

**Files Modified:**
- `.env.example` (1 inline comment moved to separate line)
- `.github/workflows/run-strategy.yml` (added 50-line ephemeral .env creation step)

## Testing

### Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test suite (`test_adapter_logging.py`) with 4 tests:

1. **test_no_adapter_logging**: Verifies clear error messages when pool not in config
2. **test_unknown_type_logging**: Verifies error messages show available types
3. **test_pool_key_resolution**: Verifies both "pool:" prefixed and bare keys work
4. **test_adapter_with_unset_type**: Verifies missing type field handling

### Test Results
All tests pass (15/15 total):
- ✅ test_pools.py - All pool configuration tests passed
- ✅ test_adapter_coverage.py - 7/7 tests passed
- ✅ test_adapter_logging.py - 4/4 tests passed
- ✅ Code review - 1 comment addressed
- ✅ CodeQL security scan - 0 vulnerabilities found

## Security Summary

### CodeQL Analysis
- **Actions workflows**: 0 alerts
- **Python code**: 0 alerts
- **Total vulnerabilities**: 0

No security issues were introduced or discovered during this implementation.

## Changes Summary

### Files Modified (4 total)
1. `bots/wave_rotation/adapters/__init__.py` - Enhanced error logging (8 lines)
2. `.env.example` - Cleaned up inline comment (1 line)
3. `.github/workflows/run-strategy.yml` - Added ephemeral .env creation (50 lines)
4. `bots/wave_rotation/test_adapter_logging.py` - New test suite (230 lines)

### Total Lines Changed
- Added: 288 lines
- Modified: 2 lines
- Total impact: 290 lines across 4 files

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
✅ **Debugging**: Clear error messages make troubleshooting adapter issues much faster
✅ **CI/CD**: Ephemeral .env provides transparency and reproducibility
✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures error handling works correctly
✅ **Maintainability**: Clean .env.example improves compatibility with parsers
✅ **Security**: No new vulnerabilities introduced

### Zero Negative Impacts
- All existing tests pass without modification
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Minimal code changes (surgical approach)
- No performance impact

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All pools in config.json have adapters defined
- [x] Pool key resolution works with and without "pool:" prefix
- [x] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [x] CI workflow creates ephemeral .env
- [x] SEARCH_SCOPE=CONFIG_ONLY is set for CI
- [x] REQUIRE_ADAPTER_BEFORE_RANK=1 is set for CI

## Conclusion

All requirements from the issue have been successfully implemented with:
- ✅ Zero "no_adapter" errors for pools in config.json (via pool key resolution)
- ✅ Clear, actionable error logging for debugging
- ✅ Appropriate selection thresholds for CI/DRY-RUN
- ✅ Clean .env/secrets management with ephemeral CI configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Zero security vulnerabilities
