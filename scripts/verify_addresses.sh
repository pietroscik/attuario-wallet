# Address Verification Script for Attuario Wallet
# ============================================================================
#
# This script helps verify ERC-20 tokens, LP tokens, and vault addresses
# on-chain using Foundry's cast tool.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Foundry installed (cast command available)
#   - RPC endpoint configured in environment variables
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/verify_addresses.sh <ADDRESS> <TYPE> [RPC_URL]
#
# Examples:
#   ./scripts/verify_addresses.sh 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006 token $BASE_RPC
#   ./scripts/verify_addresses.sh 0xA238Dd80C259a72e81d7e4664a9801593F98d1c5 vault $BASE_RPC
#   ./scripts/verify_addresses.sh 0xcF77a3Ba9A5CA399B7c97c74d54e5b1Beb874E43 router $BASE_RPC
